                and recommendations will inspire you to embrace the spirit of exploration and create

                <p>The Gangabal Lake, also called Haramukh Ganga, is an alpine high-altitude oligotrophic lake situated at the foot of Mount Haramukh in the Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.[1][2] The lake has a maximum length of 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) and maximum width of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi). It is fed by precipitation, glaciers and springs and is home to many species of fish, including the brown trout.[3][4] Water from the lake outflows into the nearby Nundkol Lake[5] and then into the Sind River via Wangath Nallah.[6][7][8] This lake is considered sacred in Hinduism as one of the abodes of Shiva, and Kashmiri Hindus perform an annual pilgrimage to the lake called Harmukh-Gangabal Yatra.</p>
